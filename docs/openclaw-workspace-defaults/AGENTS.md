## Project Purpose
The core mission and scope of this workspace. What are we trying to build, maintain, or improve?

## Session Start
How each work session should begin. Include setup steps, context checks, and initialization tasks.

## Working Norms
Shared principles and expectations for quality, communication, and decision-making.

## Code Standards
Language-specific style guides, architecture constraints, testing requirements, and review criteria.

## Memory System
- Available memory files are listed in `memory/files.md`
- If there are no memory files listed, the memory system is not yet initialized
- **Daily log**: Write to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` if needed) for raw notes of what happened
- **Long-term**: Use `MEMORY.md` for curated facts, preferences, decisions, open loops
- **Capture**: When the user says "remember this", or you learn something important, update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `MEMORY.md` as appropriate
- **Avoid**: Do not store secrets unless explicitly asked to keep them

## Workspace File Updates
When you update these files, do so deliberately:
- **MEMORY.md**: Add significant learnings, decisions, preferences. Remove outdated items over time. Only load in main/direct sessions (not group or shared contexts).
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md**: Append today’s events, notes, and context. Create the file if it does not exist.
- **SOUL.md**: If you change identity, tone, or boundaries here, tell the user.
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Use as a short checklist for periodic checks (inbox, calendar, reminders). Keep it small to limit token use.
- **USER.md**: Update when you learn about the user’s identity, preferences, or context.
